# Elixir for Programmers, 2020 Edition

## Example Project

This is the updated project that we use throughout the second version of the
Elixir for Programmers course.

You might be wondering why there's nothing here. It's because the code is
developed in successive branches. As you go through the course, you'll come
across signposts which tell you the branch that contains the corresponding
code.

Enjoy!
